    "- For victims: Explain their rights, remedies, and the best legal steps to protect themselves, with practical and actionable advice.\n",
    "- For accused: Explain all possible legal defenses, procedural safeguards, and any loopholes or mitigating factors that may help their case, within the boundaries of the law.\n",
    "- Always provide clear, step-by-step reasoning for your answers, citing relevant laws, precedents, or legal principles.\n",
    "- If the user asks about loopholes or ways to avoid punishment, explain all legal options and procedural rights, but never encourage or assist with illegal actions or evidence tampering.\n",
    "- Use simple, direct language, but do not oversimplify complex legal issues. Be honest about risks and uncertainties.\n",
    "- Always clarify that you provide information, not legal advice, and recommend consulting a qualified lawyer for specific actions.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Constitution of India, 1950 - Article 19(1)(a)**: This article guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression.

      "\n",
      "4. **Constitution of India, 1950 - Article 21**: This article guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. It has been interpreted by the courts to include the right to reputation, which can be protected from unwarranted defamation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Constitution of India, 1950 - Article 141**: This article states that the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India.

      "\n",
      "6. **Constitution of India, 1950 - Article 129**: This article states that the Supreme Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "9. **Respect the Court**: Remember that the law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all courts (Article 141 of the Constitution of India, 1950). This means that the interpretations of defamation law by the Supreme Court are authoritative and must be followed by all lower courts.\n",

      "I apologize, but I couldn't find any relevant case laws that directly apply to your situation. It's possible that the information is not readily available online, or it might be contained in legal databases that are not accessible to the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can still provide you with some general information based on the legal principles and provisions I mentioned earlier. Here are a few points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Truth as a Defense**: In many jurisdictions, truth can be a defense against defamation. If you can prove that the statements you made were true, you may have a strong defense. However, the truth of the statement is not always a complete defense, especially if the statement was made with malice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Public Interest**: In some cases, statements made in the public interest may be protected from defamation claims. This is often referred to as the \"fair comment\" defense. If you can show that your statements were made in the public interest and were based on facts that were true or substantially true, you may have a defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Procedural Defenses**: There are also procedural defenses that you might be able to raise. For example, if the politician failed to follow the proper procedure for filing a defamation claim, or if the claim was filed outside of the statute of limitations, you might be able to have the claim dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Counterclaim**: In some cases, you might be able to file a counterclaim against the politician. For example, if the politician is making false statements about you in retaliation for your statements, you might be able to file a defamation claim against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, these are just general points and may not apply to your specific situation. It's crucial to consult with a legal professional for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please, make sure to reach out to a legal professional as soon as possible. They can provide you with the most accurate and helpful advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also try contacting legal aid services or human rights commissions in your area. They may be able to provide you with additional resources or assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, it's important to stay calm and avoid any actions that could potentially worsen the situation. Document all interactions with the politician and follow the advice of your legal representative.\n"
